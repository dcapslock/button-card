## General

- Define your config template in the main lovelace configuration and then use it in your button-card. This will avoid a lot of repetitions! It's basically YAML anchors, but without using YAML anchors and is very useful if you split your config in multiple files.
- You can overload any parameter with a new one
- You can merge states together **by `id`** when using templates. The states you want to merge have to have the same `id`. This `id` parameter is new and can be anything (string, number, ...). States without `id` will be appended to the state array. Styles embedded in a state are merged together as usual. See [below](#merging-state-by-id) for an example.
- You can also inherit another template from within a template.
- You can inherit multiple templates at once by making it an array. In this case, the templates will be merged together with the current configuration in the order they are defined. This happens recursively.

      ```yaml
      type: custom:button-card
      template:
        - template1
        - template2
      ```

  The button templates will be applied in the order they are defined: `template2` will be merged with `template1` and then the local config will be merged with the result. You can still chain templates together (ie. define template in a button-card template. It will follow the path recursively).

Make sure which type of lovelace dashboard you are using before changing the main lovelace configuration:

- **`managed`** changes are managed by lovelace ui: add the template configuration to configuration in raw editor
  - go to your dashboard
  - click three dots and `Edit dashboard` button
  - click three dots again and click `Raw configuration editor` button
- **`yaml`**: add template configuration to your `ui-lovelace.yaml`

```yaml
button_card_templates:
  header:
    styles:
      card:
        - padding: 5px 15px
        - background-color: var(--paper-item-icon-active-color)
      name:
        - text-transform: uppercase
        - color: var(--primary-background-color)
        - justify-self: start
        - font-weight: bold
      label:
        - text-transform: uppercase
        - color: var(--primary-background-color)
        - justify-self: start
        - font-weight: bold

  header_red:
    template: header
    styles:
      card:
        - background-color: '#FF0000'

  my_little_template: [...]
```

And then you can apply this template, and/or overload it:

```yaml
type: custom:button-card
template: header_red
name: My Test Header
```

## Merging state by id

Example to merge state by `id`:

```yaml
button_card_templates:
  sensor:
    styles:
      card:
        - font-size: 16px
        - width: 75px
    tap_action:
      action: more-info
    state:
      - color: orange
        value: 75
        id: my_id

  sensor_humidity:
    template: sensor
    icon: 'mdi:weather-rainy'
    state:
      - color: 'rgb(255,0,0)'
        operator: '>'
        value: 50
      - color: 'rgb(0,0,255)'
        operator: '<'
        value: 25

  sensor_test:
    template: sensor_humidity
    state:
      - color: pink
        id: my_id
        operator: '>'
        value: 75
        styles:
          name:
            - color: '#ff0000'
```

Used like this:

```yaml
type: custom:button-card
template: sensor_test
entity: input_number.test
show_entity_picture: true
```

Will result in this state object for your button (styles, operator and color are overridden for the `id: my_id` as you can see):

```yaml
state:
  - color: pink
    operator: '>'
    value: 75
    styles:
      name:
        - color: '#ff0000'
  - color: 'rgb(255,0,0)'
    operator: '>'
    value: 50
  - color: 'rgb(0,0,255)'
    operator: '<'
    value: 25
```

## Variables

You can add variables to your templates and overload them in the instance of your button card. This lets you easily work with templates without the need to redefine everything for a small change.

An example below:

```yaml
button_card_templates:
  variable_test:
    variables:
      var_name: "var_value"
      var_name2: "var_value2"
    name: '[[[ return variables.var_name ]]]'

[...]

- type: custom:button-card
  template: variable_test
  entity: sensor.test
  # name will be "var_value"

- type: custom:button-card
  template: variable_test
  entity: sensor.test
  variables:
    var_name: "My local Value"
 # name will be "My local Value"
```

!!! info

    Variables are evaluated in their alphabetical order based on their name. That means a variable named `b` can depend on a variable named `a`, but variable named `a` can't depend on a variable named `b`.

This works:

```yaml
variables:
  index: 2
  value: '[[[ return variables.index + 2; ]]]'
name: '[[[ return variables.value; ]]]' # (1)!
```

1. would return 4

This doesn't work:

```yaml
variables:
  z_index: 2
  value: '[[[ return variables.z_index + 2; ]]]' # (1)!
name: '[[[ return variables.value; ]]]'
```

1. This would fail because z comes after v in the alphabet.
